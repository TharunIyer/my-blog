I think I am slowly turning into a "Self improoover", trying to optimize every second of my life like those LinkedIn bros posting their 4 AM cold shower routines. I am slowly becoming him.

And in that quest to become the optimal male, I recently came across [this article](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/4-laws-of-muscle), where Luc van Loon, through research, explains the best time to have protein, the optimal quantity and what leads to muscle loss and how to prevent it. So if you are a fellow "self improover" and want to get jacked this year, here are some pearls:

## 1. Best time to have protein

According to the science exercise makes muscles more sensitive to protein signals, enhancing muscle repair. So consume your first scoop after working out. 

Also consuming 40 grams of protein before bed boosts muscle protein synthesis during sleep. This supports muscle repair and growth overnight. So consume your last scoop just before you sleep. (Though don't blame me if you're spending extra time in the bathroom the next morning)

## 2. What leads to muscle loss?

Age. The older you get the more muscle you lose, but muscle loss is accelerated after an injury or illness where periods of inactivity increases. Just 1 week of bed rest can cause muscle loss equivalent to 3.1 pounds. Sounds less but that is the amount of muscle that you gain after strength training for 6 months.

Also, Comatose patients lose 20-30% of muscle fibre size in a matter of weeks. 

## 3. How to prevent muscle loss?

Stay active. Duh. But no seriously, even something as simple as walking, even when you are sick can prevent muscle loss. 

However, if you are bed ridden and want to ensure the damage done to you in terms of muscle loss is reduced, you can ask the hospital staff to do Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES). They might look at you weird. But hey, gains are gains. In studies, immobilized legs treated with NMES showed significantly less muscle loss compared to untreated legs. However, please note it is less effective than exercising. 

Now that you know everything there is to know about muscle building, go forth and improove yourself.
