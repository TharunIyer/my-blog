Have you ever noticed how companies are constantly searching for that one perfect employee? You know, the superhuman who can do everything - and they're willing to pay any price for them. If you're a manager, you've probably been on this hunt too. But here's the thing: finding this person feels impossible, right? Almost like searching for a unicorn.

Think about it - companies want someone who can:
- Learn, think, and solve problems quickly
- Stay responsible, organized, and hardworking
- Handle pressure like a pro and manage stress effortlessly

If you're wondering why your team seems filled with "just" average or above-average people, there's now actually a scientific explanation. Want to take a wild guess at how rare these perfect employees are? 1 in 100,000? Maybe 1 in a million? Well, you're close, but according to this [scientific paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188692400415X/pdfft?md5=a3e5a88bd7c78131ca7c6b09ebb26df5&pid=1-s2.0-S019188692400415X-main.pdf) from Associate Professor Gilles E. Gignac from the School of Psychological Science at the University of Western Australia, it's actually 1 in 20 million! That means there are only about 400 such people in the entire world. Good luck finding them - you probably have better chances of stumbling upon an actual unicorn.

## Now how was this study conducted?

The study looked at three key traits that predict success in work, life, and relationships:
- Intelligence: Your ability to learn, think critically, and solve problems
- Conscientiousness: Being responsible, organized, and hardworking
- Emotional Stability: Staying calm under pressure and handling stress well

So how rare are these "dream candidates" that companies keep searching for? Let's break it down.

- ### Notable (Above Average - 16%)
These are your solid performers - quick learners who work hard and stay level-headed. They're the ones keeping companies running smoothly, even though they might fly under the radar for not being "extraordinary." But hey, being above average in all three traits already puts you in the top 16%.

- ### Remarkable (1 Level Up - 0.94%)
Now we're talking real standout employees. Less than 1 in 100 people hit this level. They're the ones who always think two steps ahead, never miss deadlines, and handle pressure like they're on a vacation.

- ### Exceptional (2 Levels Up - 0.0085%)
This is the super rare breed. We're talking 85 people in a million. These folks are learning machines with unmatched discipline and they stay cooler under pressure than Bangalore's weather. Think about it - in a city of a million people, you'd barely find 85 of them.

- ### Profoundly Exceptional (3 Levels Up - 1 in 20 Million)
Now we've reached the unicorn level - the employee every company dreams of. We're talking about someone who can perform magic on stage, play the guitar, dominate at badminton, make videos, AND maintain a six-pack... all while answering emails. I can do all of these, by the way. Oh, and did I mention their most important trait is being humble? Just like me - I'm incredibly humble and down-to-earth. You know, the most humble person you'll ever meet!

But jokes aside a profoundly exceptional person is not just a genius, not just highly disciplined, not just emotionally stable—but all three at the same time. With only 400 of these people on earth, the chances of you winning the Kerala lottery is higher.

## Now why does this matter?

Well because recruitment and employee expectations need to change.

- First, even finding someone who's above average across all three traits is much rarer than most people realize. Companies need to start appreciating these employees more.

- Second, recruiters should remember that just because someone's super intelligent doesn't mean they'll automatically be disciplined or emotionally strong. It's like assuming someone who's great at singing will also be great at cooking.

So to all the companies and managers, stop chasing unicorns and start appreciating your above-average employees. They're already more special than you might think.

Also, if in your next appraisal your manager tells you were "above average but not exceptional," send them this article :)
